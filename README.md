EZtuff mod wiki
Description and notice:
# What does EZtuff add?
This mod adds some blocks and items related to tuff - one of the most useless materials in Minecraft. For instance:
1. Now there is a special ore and gem for tuff.
2. Tuff now has its own set of tools! They are almost alike stone tools in durability and efficiency.
3. Tuff now has a wood type which is related to it. Now you can craft any rock into tuff with 4 Tuph planks!
4. Speaking about Tuph - there now is a new forest biome for this type of wood!
5. The last and the least - we have the new gray grass for the Tuph Forest. I added it just because why not.
# Why choose EZtuff?
This mods adds a variety of blocks and items: ore, tools, wood and even a biome.
And, as I searched, it's the only tuff tools mod on the web. (may be incorrect)
# Important information for downloading 1.0
There is one bug that can crash your pc! The leaves start dropping from the Tuph trees and it causes lag. This is already fixed in an upcoming version.
Also, you can't craft wooden tools from Tuph planks and the grass in Tuph forests is normal. All of these 3 are already fixed for good. So check out the 1.1 version, please.
